I don't have much time since it's almost time for work, but today was productive. Finally set up the design guidelines I'll be using
and for now, I like it. But you know how artist brain is, its great to everyone but you. Perhaps thats something I'll grow out of. 

The idea that my work will always need improvement shouldn't be lumped in with the idea that my work needs improvement because it's bad. Even bad ideas have their uses. You can foster them into something better. 

I'm starting to get better at that phenomenon: being able to accept things you hate about yourself. Because its very much in my power to change, just like I can fix up a junk design. 

Also experimenting with githubs REST API to try to retrieve data from this very repository so I can make journal updates at will
and automatically post it to my page. looking at all the pieces now i'll have to properly breakdown exactly what needs to be a component and what doesn't. For now, let's focus on finishing the design. 

You know, the beautiful thing about it? I don't particularly like this design style. I feel like it's a crude imitation of one I actually like. But thats how art is made right? Working off of what exists and pouring your experience into it. Art is malleable 
even sculpted art. It make look like a crude imitation in the forefront, in the back of my mind I think it looks great. They didn't come up with this twist. 

I look forward to seeing how this turns out.
