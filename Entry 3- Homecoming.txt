It took awhile to get my moving and other things in order but I can comfortably say I've fully settled down. 

Getting into the routine of things again is always a weird feeling. Like coming back to a piece of code you just began after a long 
vacation. It feels short enough to have thought out everything but long enough that you don't even remember where you were going to
start. 

There are two things I have in mind particularly: remake my website in React.js and redeploy Regimen under a newer more fiting name.
I'll start with the remake first and work my way from there. I also want to fix up the jersey wyldlife project as well and use those.
Adding those 3 and maybe even more would be good. Heck, rename regimen and you have 2 seperate projects there. It'd make for a nice 
showcase. 

Additionaly, getting started on data structures and algorythms studying will begin this coming Monday. I'll figure out my schedule 
it tomorrow after work. For today it'll be planning and structuring the site. 

See, the good thing is: You already did this. So the brunt of the work is copy pasting. I'll ponder some design ideas at work to
get the busy work out of the way. And speaking of, it's time to get ready for work.
