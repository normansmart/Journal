It's been 2 months since i graduated from Flatiron school and the experience even now
it still feels surreal. And now i'm in this phase of "what now?" 
I will say, the stability of being in an environment where my one and only focus is to code and learn 
is probably what i miss the most. It felt like work, more so, it self like i was coding for a purpose 
beyond just learning. I was building, creating, making friends and connections. Being in school 
if for nothing else showed me why I want this life. It made sense. To teach, to help to learn and 
and most of all to create. 

Though i have a long ways to go in terms of learning. Moving into the next phase of my life
as a developer I find it emppty only because of the lack of people, but it took me too long to realize
that. Now that it's just me and my PC, i've come to understand that i'm truly nit really alone in this.
There's so much work on Github, so much inspiration on Dribble and Behance. So many commits i havent made.
But I will get there. One day at a time. 

Today I'll be adding the final feature to my keystone and record my demo days after. 
I have to keep moving.
