Before flatiron, I was a ux/ui designer and the most I knew of coding was HTML/CSS. 
But, and I'm sure this was true with everyone who first starts out. I hated javascript. 

With a passion. 

I just didn't understand it. All the complex functions how and when to use variables...what even are variebles?
It's like I was reading swedish. But it made sense. Even when using jquery for my designing 
I could tell how the functions worked, how it would make sense. But then i see pure javascript 
and nothing makes sense. I was missing the contextual syntax that makes it make sense. 
I was missing the organization and structure it would take to learn period. And learning javascript
was interesting. And that's about what i'll give it for now. 

Though in my second week it kind of all came to me. 
The functions, the variables the syntax. Everything that made me scared to learn it became 
a tool that empowered me to make whatever I want. In that instance, all the app designs I made 
seemed like more than just mere concepts. I could actually bring my designs into the real world. 
And that was the truly empowering part of conquering my fears with javascript. 

I'm going to make Regimen into an app.
