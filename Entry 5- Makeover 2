I'm beginning to understand Githubs REST API. Making calls from my account to show live updates of commit messages in certain repos
is the current objective and it's coming together amazingly. I was able to make it work through the curl process, but octokit's await 
is not working. And treats the response to json like and object key value pair and tries to invoke it....into a red screen.

I will try using a different async method and try again with better security measures to protect my access token. 

The structure is looking good too. To increase work efficiency, I will try to build with as little pages as possible. And increase component usage efficiency. I can't have a bunch of things strung about my file page. The Figma designs were built for this purpose, after all. 

Speaking of Figma designs, since this will be in React, i'll test out the Container CSS mod that moises taught me to also reduce on file capacity/size. I'd say half the skeleton is done. Pictures will be posted on the blog so for now I will tackle the API calls before working on anything specific. 

Here's to the next update.
